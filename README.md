## Overview üìö

This repository contains the starter code for the *Totally Ordered Multicast* recitation tool. The implementation is based on the totally ordered multicast algorithm described by van Steen in *Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms* (4th Edition, Chapter 5.2).

The tool utilizes Lamport Logical Clocks and message queues to manage the delivery of messages, ensuring that messages are received in a totally ordered sequence across all nodes. 

## Features ‚ú®

- **Lamport Logical Clocks:** ‚è∞ Used to assign timestamps to messages to maintain ordering.
- **Message Queues:** üì• Handle incoming messages and ensure they are processed in the correct order.
- **ACK Mechanism:** ‚úÖ Each incoming message is acknowledged to ensure liveness in the system. This results in a communication overhead of O(n¬≤) messages.

## Performance ‚öôÔ∏è

The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n¬≤) due to the use of ACKs for each incoming message. While this ensures message delivery and system liveness, the complexity could be reduced by eliminating the ACKs. However, doing so would require ensuring that all nodes regularly send messages to maintain synchronization and prevent deadlocks.

## Future Improvements üîÆ

- **Reducing Communication Overhead:** üîß Investigate ways to minimize the number of ACKs required to maintain system consistency.
- **Optimization:** ‚ö° Explore techniques to reduce the overall complexity and improve scalability for larger systems.
